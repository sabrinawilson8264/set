## Modelling End Game Configurations in Set

### Background Information
include the following 
* a bit of history of the game set
* * a bit about monte carlo simulation
* generalising the game of set to different dimensions and values.
* Explain cap sets

  
### Introduction
This report is interested in the probability distribution of different configurations of the "end game" of set. That is, what is the probability that there is a particular number of cards left on the board at the end of the game, none of which make sets with any other cards on the board. For now, we will discuss the conventional game of set in which there are 4 dimensions (colour, shape, number, filling) and three possible values for each dimension. From [reference The Joy of Set], we know that if there are more than 20 cards on the board, there must be a set amongst them. Therefore, at the end of the game, there can be no more than 20 cards present. For obvious reasons, once all cards are dealt on to the table there must be a multiple of three cards present. For reasons that are also obvious, the number of cards left on the board cannot be less than 0. Based on this, the possible number of cards left on the board at the end of the game are: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. 

It has been shown that the game cannot end with 3 cards on the table. [https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/teacherscorner/DEVELOPING%20MATHEMATICAL%20REASONING.pdf]

So, we are left with the following possibilities: 0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. 

The probability distribution for the number of cards left on the table in the conventional game of set is well documented [reference the joy of set]. The purpose of this report is to ask the question - is the probability distribution the same in different dimensions of the game?      

#### What I'm interested in finding out
Is the probability distribution for end game configurations independent of dimension and number of values per dimension? 
lets compare
probability distribution for 4 dimensional set with 3 values per dimension to
probability distribution for 3 dimensional set with 3 values per dimension to 
probability distribution for 3 dimensional set with 4 values per dimension to 
probability distribution for 4 dimensional set with 4 values per dimension
