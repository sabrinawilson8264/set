# SET!
The code and information contained in this repo are all about the card game SET. I've done my best to explain how the game works for readers who might not have been exposed to it before, but if this is your first time hearing about the game I recommend checking out a video on how the game is played (like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgTcVZdMMYg) to get some familiarity with it. 

The official rules of SET use the word "features" to refer to colours, shapes, numbers and shading. I will alternate between calling them features, dimensions and attributes. 

I've tried my best to distinguish between SET (the game), set (a group of cards that satisfy the rule of the game) and set (the python object) in the report by using capital letters for the game, lowercase for a group of cards that satisfy the rule of the game, and clarifying in parenthesis when I'm talking about the python object (thankfully that only comes up once). 

Hopefully readers will find this interesting!
