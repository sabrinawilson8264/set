## Modelling End Game Configurations in Set

### Background Information
include the following 
* a bit of history of the game set
  * Many questions that arise naturally during the game are mathematical in nature. Whats the probability that, after dealing 12 cards on the table, no sets are present?
  * How many sets exist within the game?
  * what's the maximum number of cards that can be dealt before there must be a set present?
* a bit about monte carlo simulation
* 
### Introduction
#### What I'm interested in finding out
Is the probability distribution for end game configurations independent of dimension and number of values per dimension? 
lets compare
probability distribution for 4 dimensional set with 3 values per dimension to
probability distribution for 3 dimensional set with 3 values per dimension to 
probability distribution for 3 dimensional set with 4 values per dimension to 
probability distribution for 4 dimensional set with 4 values per dimension
